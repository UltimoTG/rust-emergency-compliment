> a tutorial for beginner web development in Rust

Hi! Do you want to learn Rust? Do you come from a web programming background?
Traditionally, Rust is considered a systems language, but you can do web development
in it, too. This tutorial will help teach you how to build a very simple web
application is Rust using the [pencil] library.

## Getting Started

To get your environment set up, we'll have you follow the instructions for
getting the pre-written application up and running. Then we'll write it from scratch,
together!

### Install Rust

The best way to install Rust is with [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/). rustup is a Rust
version manager. To install it type:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

To keep your rust up-to-date with the latest stable version of rust,
type:

```
rustup update
```

To check which version of Rust you have type:

```
rustc -- version
```

### Run the Application

Now let's get the app up and running. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. cd `rust-emergency-compliment`
3. `cargo run`
4. Visit [`http://localhost:7878`](http://localhost:7878)
